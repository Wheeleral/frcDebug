In this branch you'll learn about logging with Network Tables and System.


Goals:

*In robot.java have the variables topSpeed, bottomSpeed and enabled to be read in as values from network helpers.
*In robot.java print out the speed values using -System.out.println()
*Have kP, kI, kD, and kF be read in as network table values in NeoMotor.java, make sure there are default values.
*In StateMachine.java use network tables to display the name of the state in runState
